## **Transfer data/functions from main Vue app to the component**

- component only stores the data of a single friend, so we add the 'data' property 'detailAreAvailable' back to the component won't have the previous problem.

## **Build template of component**

- And later we will teach how to define template in a better way instead of string template.
