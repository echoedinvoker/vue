## **page and error**

![Alt error on page](pic/03.jpg)

- When we don't use Vue CLI, there is no problem when using v-for iterate HTML element without 'key', but Vue CLI will generate an error, which shows that Vue CLI is more stringent.

- After adding the 'key', the page did not show what I expected, I will fix this problem later in the course.
